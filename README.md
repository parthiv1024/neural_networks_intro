# Introduction to Neural Networks
## Overview
This repository contains 2 programs. One is a single neuron neural network made from scratch using numpy.  
The second one is an image processing neural network created using Tensorflow and it works on the popular dataset MNIST.
## Dependencies
The neural_network.py program uses numpy. To install numpy run -  
sudo pip3 install numpy or sudo pip install numpy  
The tensorflow_neural_network.py program uses tensorflow. To install tensorflow run -
sudo pip3 install tensorflow or sudo pip install tensorflow
